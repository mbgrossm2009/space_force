                <div class="col-md-12 caption">While speaking to US Marines in San Diego on Tuesday, President Donald Trump suggested creating a branch of the military for space. "My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a war-fighting domain just like the land, air and sea," Trump said at Miramar Air Station. "We may even have a Space Force."
                "You know, I was saying it the other day cause we're doing a tremendous amount of work in space," Trump said. "I said 'maybe we need a new force, we'll call it the space force.' And I was not really serious, and then I said 'what a great idea, maybe we'll have to do that.'"
